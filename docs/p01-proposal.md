## Developer Notes

* **Where is the project brief?**  [`../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf`](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf).
* **Making Progress**: We understand this work might be difficult. Also, we understand that your project ideas might not be completely worked out. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will receive specific guidance from your TA and constructive feedback. We are confident that you will succeed!
* **What should be included in the proposal?** Every proposal will be different. It depends on your particular project.  That said, in the table below you will find the expected report elements.  It is important that you engage with and respond to the the Design Brief.
* **How should the proposal be formatted?** You should format your proposal using Markdown in this file. You should aim for a professional presentation - clear, concise, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors.
* **What headings should we use?** As needed, the suggested headings below can be revised and new headings and sub-headings can be added. Please use headings, bullet lists, tables, figures, and other markdown code effectively - seek a professional presentation.
* **Finishing up.** When you are finished writing and formatting your proposal, save these developer notes(they might useful in the future). Then, delete them.
* **Questions?** If you have questions, please ask your TA or post on Teams.

|Abstract | No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: **(1)** "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." **(2)** "We are concerned with ..., becuase .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." **(3)** "Consider that ....  This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."   |
|Keywords | 3-5 keywords that summarize your project.  (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data") |
|1.0 Introduction | In our group project we will be analyzing the different statistics of homeless in different states. The dataset is based on different categories like unsheltered, sheltered, and many more. Throughout our analyzation we will be uncovering the trends between homelessness in different states and why they were changed overtime. It's important that we recognize this homeless crisis because our country lacks housing resources for underprivileged people. We also want to focus on how housing is an economic problem. Economically, we need to provide homeless people with more job opportunities and help build them financially so this homeless crisis won't continue. By analyzing the data we will be able to use these trend to discuss how we can make a significant change in our housing system. We will also discuss how the government can financially support the homeless and provide them with resources to better improve themselves.
|2.0 Design Situation | Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, research papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (about 400 words) |
Project Framing:
The topic of concern for our project is the homeless crisis that is occurring in America. The homeless crisis is currently growing because of the lack of resources that America provides for its citizens. One of the main key elements is economic because as rent and housing prices rise immensely, there needs to be a push for more affordable housing in American cities. It would be much cheaper to provide homeless people with affordable housing than to put them into homeless shelters.  
Human Values:
The values that are connected within our topic are fighting this homeless crisis to bring a sense of community. We must understand that homeless people are human and need to feel a sense of belonging. If America continues to neglect homeless people, we want to be able to fight this homeless crisis. Homeless people are in a constant cycle of trauma before and after they become homeless. If we also focus on how we can have a system that provides for emotional damage we can fight this homeless crisis.
Direct and Indirect stakeholders:
The direct stakeholders for this homeless crisis are the federal government and housing providers of housing and services. If the US government funds housing providers we will be able to build affordable housing and fight this crisis. The indirect stakeholders are American citizens because this homeless crisis can happen to anyone so it's important that we make sure to have a plan if it does happen.
Harms and Benefits:
If interventions are taken using data and technology the possible benefits are creating a healthier economy. As mentioned by common bond communities, "when people have access to quality affordable housing options, they are far less likely to face environmental threats, and far more likely to have enough income for healthy food options and routine medical careâ€”ultimately helping them lower the risk of severe chronic health problems." By building these houses, the community can use the funding to build a better community.
|3.0 Research questions | 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words) |
How does the percentage of each homelessness category (unsheltered vs sheltered) change in each state from 2007 to 2016?
- How can this dataset become a foundational skill to change this homelessness crisis?
- How can the trend of homeless we see determine
-  What are the trends in homeless populations by the state in regards to families vs. individuals?
- What groups of people (age, veterans, families, etc) are most likely to be sheltered vs unsheltered?
The motivation for these questions is help better understand the trends of homeless populations over the years and find solutions to combat this issue. These questions will also allow us to gain more information about the homeless crisis and how it affects one's daily life.
|4.0 The Dataset | See Design Brief, setions B.5 (_Size and complexity_) and B.6 (_Data provenance_). Use short sub-sections for describing the size and complexity of the dataset and for describing the origins fo the data. (about 400 words) |
|5.0 Expected Implications | Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (about 150 words) |
|6.0 Limitations | What limitations might you need to address? Briefly discuss. (about 150 words) |
|Acknowledgements | Is there anyone you would like to thank? A librarian who helped you with your research? A Teaching Assistant? A friend who helped you find your data? Say thank you in this section.|
