## Developer Notes

* **Where is the project brief?**  [`../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf`](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf).
* **Making Progress**: We understand this work might be difficult. Also, we understand that your project ideas might not be completely worked out. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will receive specific guidance from your TA and constructive feedback. We are confident that you will succeed!
* **What should be included in the proposal?** Every proposal will be different. It depends on your particular project.  That said, in the table below you will find the expected report elements.  It is important that you engage with and respond to the the Design Brief.
* **How should the proposal be formatted?** You should format your proposal using Markdown in this file. You should aim for a professional presentation - clear, concise, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors.
* **What headings should we use?** As needed, the suggested headings below can be revised and new headings and sub-headings can be added. Please use headings, bullet lists, tables, figures, and other markdown code effectively - seek a professional presentation.
* **Finishing up.** When you are finished writing and formatting your proposal, save these developer notes(they might useful in the future). Then, delete them.
* **Questions?** If you have questions, please ask your TA or post on Teams.

|Abstract | We are concerned with how the number of homeless varies by year and region and how certain groups are more likely to be homeless. To address this concern, we plan to analyze our datasets to find trends in who is most likely to end up homeless and find other factors that influence homelessness rates. We hope that by identifying these trends, we can gain a better idea of which groups need help and how to best help them. |

|4.0 The Dataset | Data Origins: Our dataset is Point-in-Time data of homeless populations in the US from 2007 to 2016. The CSV file came from Kaggle user ‘def love(x)’ , and the data is credited to the HUD Exchange. The HUD Exchange is an exchange of information and resources surrounding homelessness in the US run by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a department in the federal government, HUD serves a variety of purposes for a variety of people. These tasks also include organizing and providing resources to homeless individuals. The data is widely available and used mainly by different local governments and other groups supporting housing on a local level, as it is widely available and relatively detailed and accurate. HUD has many resources discussing how the collection process works in great detail. They also have information on their website about how the data should be collected to give power to the homeless communities, and emphasizes the use of the collected data to aid those communities. Data Features: Each of the 86,529 observations represents a specific group of homeless individuals for an area. These groups include a variety of classifications including, for example, ‘Sheltered Individuals’ or ‘Unsheltered Chronically Homeless People in Families.’ The many groupings cover whether the individuals are sheltered, chronically homeless, in families, and, beginning in 2011, veterans. There is also an entry for each area’s total homeless population. The different areas that the values are reported for are identified by CoC names and numbers. CoC refers to Continuum of Care programs, which assist homeless populations in a given area and report the data to HUD. The CoC’s tend to correlate with counties or other groupings within states and are named as such. CoC numbers use the state abbreviation followed by a dash and a 3 digit number Other variables reported include the year of the observation, the state in which the county falls and the number of individuals that fall into that group. Years are recorded as the 1st of January of that year, as the data takes some time to collect and is reported on a yearly basis only. |
|5.0 Expected Implications | Identifying trends in the populations that are homeless could help to target areas of particular need and individuals who need aid. Much of our research is interested in the identities of those who are homeless and we are interested in who is more likely to be homeless, whether sheltered or unsheltered, chronically or not. In addition, we’ll be looking at trends related to location and time, to see how those factor into the size of the homeless populations. These could all help to inform policymakers as to what and where aid is needed. In addition, this data could be brought back to the CoCs who compiled it, to help direct them to what is happening in their communities and to help them look at the issues in a new light. Overall, we hope that the answers to our research questions benefit individuals who are experiencing homelessness, in any way that it can. |
|6.0 Limitations | This data covers a large group of people whose situations are often changing and it is recorded by a variety of individuals. This leads to some limitations on the accuracy of the data, as it isn’t necessarily consistently recorded and accounted for. This indicates that there may be some errors in our analyses, however they likely aren’t huge limitations. In addition, there is relatively limited categories of individuals who are homeless. For example, we can investigate categories, such as sheltered or chronic homelessness, but we cannot look at factors such as a specific location or background. This means that although we are looking for trends, we may not be able to see the true reasoning behind some of the trends, if they are impacted by factors that are not available to us. We are only looking at correlations of the data, but may not be able to discover the truth behind the trends of which individuals are likely to need support. |
